# Application Features

## Multiple Language Toggle and Support

Users can change between multiple languages supported by our web application. Flashcards and saved translations will be specific to languages within user accounts, so users can have different progress for each language they are learning. 

## Translation and Saving of Phrases and Words

Translation will involve allowing users to input one language to output another. We will use language APIs to fetch and request for outputs. Translations done can be saved and put into flashcards or word banks to be used for further memorization and exercises. This allows users to pick what they want to focus on and build studying that is geared towards their interests. 

## Deeper Translation or Definitions of Selected Words

In addituon to simple translation one feature that we can implement is more specific definitions or words that are highlighted by the user. This would be from another API, and allows a user to understand words and phrases more deeply. This can look like hovering out or highlighting an area in the translation, and receiving a drop down of known defintions for that word in the users preferred language. Like translataed phrases, these definitons can also be saved for later use.

## Flashcards and Exercises for Saved Flashcards

Flashcards for studying can be made, categorized, and sorted based on the users input. These flashcards can ask as the "material" for studying via the web app. That is, exercises will use these saved translations or definitions to quiz the user to gain retention.

Exercises could include: matching games (words/phrases falling from the sky, card matching).

## Account Credientials and Saving for ongoing Studying

Users can set up an account and be added to our database so that they can interact with the application and save translations/definitons they find. They can chose have multiple language studying occur at once and can toggle each independently. Data will be saved in our caches. Accounts can also lead to other features like translations of the day or special exercises or reminders.

## Learning Goals and Objective Setting

With accounts, users can set objectives and goals for themselves. This could be daily number of exercises done or number of flashcards made. This gives users the desire to come back and  learn more, keeping themselves accountable.
