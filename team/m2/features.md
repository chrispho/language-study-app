# Application Features

## Multiple Language Toggle and Support

Users can change between multiple languages supported by our web application. Flashcards, saved translations, and progress will be specific to each languages within user accounts, so users can easily switch between languages.

## Translation and Saving of Phrases and Words

Translation will involve allowing users to input one language to output another. We will use language APIs to fetch and request outputs. Translations can be saved and put into flashcards and word banks to be used for further memorization and exercises. This allows users to pick what they want to focus on and build study sets that are geared towards their interests.

## Deeper Translation or Definitions of Selected Words

In addition to translating input text, the application will have support for more specific definitions or words when highlighted by the user. This would be from another API, and allows a user to pick out words they don't know and quickly see their translation and definition. This can be hovering over or highlighting an area in the translation and receiving a drop down of known defintions for that word in the user's preferred language. Like translataed phrases, these definitons can also be saved for later use.

## Flashcards and Exercises for Saved Flashcards

Flashcards for studying can be made, categorized, and sorted based on user input. These flashcards can be used as material for studying via exercise and learning functionality in the web app. Exercises will use these saved translations or definitions to quiz the user to aid in memorization and language learning.

Exercises could include: matching games (words/phrases falling from the sky, card matching), sentence translation, fill in the blank, multiple choice, and more.

## Account Credientials and Saving for ongoing Studying

Users can set up an account and be added to our database so that they can interact with the application and save translations/definitons they find. They can chose to do exercises with multiple language studying sets and can toggle each independently.  

## Learning Goals and Objective Setting

With accounts, users can set objectives and goals for themselves and receive reminders for their goals. This could be daily number of exercises done or number of flashcards made. Depending on complexity, there will be daily and special exercises tailored to each user or language. This gives users the desire to come back and learn more, keeping themselves accountable.
