On this screen, users can interact with four main elements:

1. **Flashcards**: A pie chart that visually represents the user's spending across different categories. Hovering over each slice of the pie will display the exact amount spent in that category, giving users a detailed breakdown without overwhelming them with numbers.
2. **Translation Tool**: Below the pie chart, there will be a progress bar showing the user’s progress toward their savings goal. This element provides a quick visual indicator of how close the user is to achieving their goal.
3. **Exercise tab**: A prominent button labeled “Log Expense” will be located at the top right of the dashboard. Clicking this button will take users to the **Expense Logging Screen**, where they can add new expenses.
4. **Sign up/ Log in**: User can either sign up to become a member and save their progress or log-in if they are an existing user.
5. **Footer**: Optional links to privacy policy, terms, or other legal information could be placed here.

This screen is designed to be the central hub of the user’s experience, after the sign up/ log-in, the options/buttons will not be visible. 

**Use Case**: 

A new user visiting the homepage can either join the platform by creating an account or log in if they are already registered. After logging in, the user sees their profile in the top-right corner and can navigate to other sections like flashcards, translation, or exercises using the header.

The **Flashcards Screen** allows users to create easily view all their different flashcards on one page. They are organized into folders, displayed on the main page with an option to add more folders - this way, the user can make different categories of words and or different languages. They would be able to name each folder.


Inside each folder, the user will be allowed to create each of their own flashcards as well as create them. They would be prompted to type two different inputs for the front and back of each flashcard. Then they will be able to review the cards at their own discretion. This page is meant to be easy to use and for quick references and review of vocabulary words.


**Use Case**:


With a few minutes to spare between classes, a user can navigate to this page to quickly quiz themselves on a few words that they recently learned in a previous lesson in the application. They can click on a set of words featuring foods in French and see if they know how what the English word is given the French word on the front of the flashcard.

## Exercise Screen

The **exercise tab** allows users to practice language skills through interactive exercises like matching words, multiple choice, or fill-in-the-blank questions.

The layout of this screen is kept minimal to avoid overwhelming the user.
1. **Instructions Panel**: At the top of the main section, users receive instructions for the current exercise. For example, the instruction might be: **"Choose the correct translation for the word 'chien'"**.
2. **Exercise Area**: Displays a question. Users can either select the correct option or input the answer, depending on the exercise type.
3. **Submit Button**: After making their choice or inputting an answer, users click the **"Submit"** button to check if their response is correct.
4. **Feedback Panel**:After submitting, users see immediate feedback. If their answer is correct, they might see a message like **"Correct!"**. If incorrect, they will see **"Try again"**. 

**Use Case**:

## Translation Screen

The **Translation Screen** allows users to easily translate between different languages. It is designed to be straightforward, with a text field on the left for users to type or paste content that they want to be translated into a different language.

For additional features, 
1. There will be a **copy button** so that users can easily and quickly copy text from any translation into their clipboard to paste into other applications. 
2. There will also be a **new translation button** so that the user can easily clear the content in the textbox on the right to translate a different word/phrase.

**Use Case**: A user is trying to learn how to say a specific phrase in French. They would type their phrase into the next box on the right. The translated phrase would appear in the other text box and the user can decide if they would like to copy it or move on to a new translation - each with their own respective buttons for intuitiveness.
