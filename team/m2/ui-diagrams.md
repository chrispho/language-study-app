On this screen, users can interact with four main elements:

1. **Flashcards**: A pie chart that visually represents the user's spending across different categories. Hovering over each slice of the pie will display the exact amount spent in that category, giving users a detailed breakdown without overwhelming them with numbers.
2. **Translation Tool**: Below the pie chart, there will be a progress bar showing the user’s progress toward their savings goal. This element provides a quick visual indicator of how close the user is to achieving their goal.
3. **Exercise tab**: A prominent button labeled “Log Expense” will be located at the top right of the dashboard. Clicking this button will take users to the **Expense Logging Screen**, where they can add new expenses.
4. **Sign up/ Log in**: User can either sign up to become a member and save their progress or log-in if they are an existing user.
5. **Footer**: Optional links to privacy policy, terms, or other legal information could be placed here.

This screen is designed to be the central hub of the user’s experience, after the sign up/ log-in, the options/buttons will not be visible. 

**Use Case**: 

A new user visiting the homepage can either join the platform by creating an account or log in if they are already registered. After logging in, the user sees their profile in the top-right corner and can navigate to other sections like flashcards, translation, or exercises using the header.
